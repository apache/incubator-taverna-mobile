There are two tabs on the dashboard, the second tab presents a list of marked workflows. there is a menu button the pulls out a navigation drawer menu from the left corner of the dashboard. You can also swipe finger from the extreme left of the screen to pull out the menu. Scrolling to the bottom of the workflow screen will load more workflows.

    <string name="usage_menus">Usage | Menus</string>
    <string name="usage_menu_Text">The navigation drawer brings up a menu. The workflow menu item allows one to quickly return to the workflow streams page from any screen.

    <string name="usage_detail">Usage | Workfow Detail</string>
    <string name="usage_detail_text">The details screen allows users to run particular worklows and provides detailed information about the workflows. Workflows can also be downloaded from here.
